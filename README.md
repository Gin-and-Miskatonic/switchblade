Switchblade.py
======
**Switchblade** is a script based on the python Netcat library (nclib) that catches raw tcp shells in the same way as a netcat listener, but adds several convenience features such as a command history and local command execution.

```
$ ./switchblade [-p Port] [--send-log filepath] [--recv-log filepath]
 Victim Connected!
$ <This prompt now sends commands to the victim>
```
